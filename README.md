# SurveillanceManager
 -Designed and developed SurveillanceManager, a Java-based software system for analyzing and reporting on telecommunication data. Key highlights include:
Data Processing and Analysis: Engineered functionality to parse and process structured input files, including detailed call records and personal contact information.

 -Report Generation: Created dynamic reporting tools to:
 
 -Summarize call histories by individual, ordered by timestamp and call ID.
 
 -Conduct multi-hop network analysis, identifying individuals within specified connection ranges.
 
 -Robust Error Handling: Implemented safeguards to handle invalid or missing data gracefully, ensuring a seamless user experience.
 
 -Performance Optimization: Achieved efficient data processing, meeting stringent performance benchmarks for large datasets. 
 
 -Design Constraints: Developed the system exclusively using list-based data structures, ensuring simplicity and compliance with project constraints.

This project provided valuable experience in building scalable, data-intensive applications and optimizing performance in complex analytical workflows.
