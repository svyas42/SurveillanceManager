# SurveillanceManager
-Developed SurveillanceManager, a Java-based program for analyzing and reporting on telecommunication data. Key features include:

 -Data Processing: Parsed input files containing phone call records and personal information.
 
 
 Report Generation: Generated reports that display:
 
 -Call histories for individuals in chronological order.
 
 -A network of people connected within a specified number of phone call “hops.”
 
-Error Handling: Added functionality to handle invalid or missing input files and data.

-Performance: Ensured reports could be generated quickly, meeting requirements for large datasets.

-Design Constraints: Used list-based data structures to meet specific project guidelines.

This project focused on processing large datasets efficiently, organizing information clearly, and meeting strict performance requirements.
